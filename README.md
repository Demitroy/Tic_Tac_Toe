# Tic_Tac_Toe
Writing a Python 3 version of Tic Tac Toe


First version (v1) is a working board with user input, and alternating markings between 'X' and 'O'.

Next version will include some additional functionality.  This will hopefully include a board evaluator at the end of each play
to determine if a winner has emerged or if the board has been filled without a winner.
